						<p class="lead">Enablabling a hassle-free community-living experience for a set of co-living residencies</p> 
						<p> <a href="https://stayabode.com/" target="_blank">StayAbode</a> is a bunch of fully serviced co-living spaces that mix small private spaces with communal areas to create vibrant, community driven residencies. For aspiring millenials, StayAbode offers a premium, modern way of urban living. 
</p>
<p>
Each building is managed and maintained by a building manager. As the business gained traction, more and more residents moved in, making it increasingly difficult for managers to manually track and resolve daily issues. I worked with the StayAbode team to design their resident and manager apps. The apps not only faciliated communication between residents and building managers and but also helped the managers troubleshoot issues more efficiently.
</p>


						<br>
            						<h2>UX Journeys</h2>
                        <p>

Our building managers spent most of their time answering calls-resolving building issues, following up with service staff and reminding residents to pay rent. As they were always occupied, it was proving difficult for them to plan and organise their day efficiently. Using apps, many of the processes could be easily automated, saving valuable time for both residents and managers.</p>

<p>Keeping both the resident and manager experiences in focus, we jotted down use cases that could be simplified or automated. While doing this exercise, we also wanted to encourage community living by facilitating interaction between the residents.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
						<p>As is evident from the jorney flows, residents and managers were the two ends of the same communication channel. Requests by the residents transalted into actions for the managers and vice versa. Since the resident and manager apps were designed to be quite similar to each other, it saved the team a lot of development effort.</p>

<h2>Key features</h2>
<p>Building on the TinyOwl apps, we included features like order status, live delivery tracking and order feedback to provide a comprehensive delivery experience. Some key ideas we worked on were:<br> 
<br>
<b>1. Recent restaurants</b><br> Users frequently order from the restaurants they’re familiar with and trust. 75% of the users order from the same 5 restaurant 85% of the time.<br> 
<br>
<b>2. Moods</b><br> Moods are sets of speciality restaurants grouped by cuisine. People who want to discover new food, usually find it easier to recognize a cuisine or a food type than choosing restaurants or applying filters. 
<br> 
<br>
<b>3. Recommended items</b><br> The most selling items of a restaurant are shown upfront. This eased decision making and increased the click- through rate. 
<br>
<br>
<b>4. Add-ons</b><br> Add ons are items that complement food items users add to their cart. With data collected over 2 years, we mapped items frequently ordered together. It saved users from the hassle of navigating through the menu. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Delivery focussed features</h3>
<p><b>A. Order status</b><br> People usually tend to be  impatient when they're hungry and waiting for their food. Users should be able to track their order in real time till it is delivered. Order status needs to be upfront and easily accessible, as users generally check the same several times. <br>
<br>
<b>B. Delivery tracking</b><br> Users could track their order on a map. For more help, they could contact the delivery boy — enabling Runnr to deliver a fully transparent delivery experience. </p>

<h2>Bonus Project: Runnr Meals</h2>
<p>We created Runnr meals — a corporate ordering platform aimed at providing pocket-friendly alternatives to insipid canteen food. Corporate employees were granted a monthly budget for their meals by their employers. As the service is pre-paid, checkout is super fast and the order through rate is extremely high. Users order from a limited, fresh menu everyday. Orders are placed in a specific time window. This enabled restautants to not only create additional demand, but also plan their operations better. We successfully reduced the number of delivery touchpoints by clubbing deliveries — greatly reducing logistic costs.

               Modular systems help create UI at a very fast pace. We also documented the guidelines helping us scale the app and design upcoming features. Guidelines evolve through the life-cycle of the product. They should be flexible enough to accomodate new patterns and enable innovation. Runnr was <a href="https://www.zomato.com/blog/introducing-the-zomato-runnr">acquired</a> by food-tech giant Zomato in September 2017.
